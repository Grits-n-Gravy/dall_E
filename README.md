# NotOpenAI.net - AI Image Generation Application - Readme

Welcome to NotOpenAI.net, an AI Image Generation Application! This application was built with the intention of learning more about the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) as well as the OpenAI API. This Readme provides an overview of the application's features and other important details.

## Features

1. **Image Generation**: The core feature of NotOpenAI.net is the AI-powered image generation. Users can provide input such as keywords or text descriptions, and the application will use the OpenAI API and a pre-trained AI model to generate unique and visually appealing images.

2. **Community Showcase**: NotOpenAI.net provides a gallery view where users can browse and view previously generated images and the prompts used. It allows for easy access and retrieval of saved images.

3. **Image Download**: NotOpenAI.net enables users to download the generated images directly to their devices. This feature allows users to utilize the images in various contexts such as presentations, designs, or personal use.

## Usage

1. **Generate Images**: Use the intuitive interface on NotOpenAI.net to generate images and share them in a gallery view showcase. Enter your name as well as keywords or text descriptions that capture the desired visual concept, and the AI model will generate unique images based on the input.

2. **View Community Showcase**: Navigate to the community section on NotOpenAI.net to view previously generated images. Easily access images for reference or further sharing.

3. **Share and Download Images**: Share your generated images with others by copying the image URL. Additionally, download the images to your device for offline use or further manipulation.

## Technologies Used

NotOpenAI.net is built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A powerful NoSQL database used for storing generated images and other application data.

- **Express.js**: A flexible and minimalistic web application framework for building the server-side RESTful API.

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, used for the client-side development of NotOpenAI.net.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code on the server-side.

- **OpenAI API**: The OpenAI API is integrated into NotOpenAI.net to access the pre-trained AI model and generate images based on user input.
